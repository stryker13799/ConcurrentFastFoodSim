# ConcurrentFastFoodSim
ConcurrentFastFoodSim is a comprehensive simulation of a fast-food restaurant's service workflow, with a strong emphasis on Operating Systems concepts such as multithreading, concurrency control, and resource synchronization. It models the real-time interactions between Managers, Cooks, Waiters, and Customers. It showcases the creation of multiple service threads to manage the demand of several customers, ensuring that multiple orders can be processed simultaneously. The system is designed to calculate preparation times, manage sales transactions, and synchronize service delivery, all while maintaining data consistency. The final comparison of daily sales by waiters and the restaurant serves as a practical example of resource management and reporting in concurrent environments. This project serves as an excellent educational tool for understanding the application of OS principles in system design and resource allocation.
